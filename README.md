This repository is the implementation of the paper ``**Securing Power Systems: A Variational Autoencoder Framework for Robust, Physics-Informed Cyberattack Recognition**".

Figure below denotes the proposed architecture used for online inference, after offline training of the variational autoencoder (VAE), the recurrent neural network (RNN), and the dense layer for classification.
